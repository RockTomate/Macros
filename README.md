# RockTomate Macros Repository

Here you can find source code for RockTomate's macros (**not RockTomate plugin itself, which must be [purchased](http://u3d.as/1EfM)**)

## What is RockTomate?

RockTomate is an editor extension that allows you to automate repetitive tasks within the Unity engine. Tasks could be as simple as creating scenes or as complicated as building a project for multiple platforms with different configurations.

Feel free to visit [Unity Asset Store](http://u3d.as/1EfM) for more info.

## What are Macros?

Macros are lightweight functions that accept parameters and return a value: just like an ordinary function. They're called from within formulas.
